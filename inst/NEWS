### Changes to functions

* ppl_select_recorded_eye: This function has been changed to reflect the most recent version of SR DataViewer (4.1.1), which now labels EYE_TRACKED with "Binocular", rather than "Both". The updated code now allows for both types of input.  Thank you to Jesse Harris for bringing this to our attention.
